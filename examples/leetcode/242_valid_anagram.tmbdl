~ LeetCode #242: Valid Anagram
~ Difficulty: Easy
~ Tags: Hash Table, String, Sorting

~*
  Given two strings s and t, answer goldberry if t is an anagram of s,
  and sauron otherwise.

  An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word,
  using all the original letters exactly once.

  Examples:
    s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"  =>  goldberry
    s = "rat", t = "car"          =>  sauron

  Constraints:
    - 1 <= length(s), length(t) <= 50000
    - s and t consist of lowercase English letters

  Follow-up: What if inputs contain Unicode characters?
