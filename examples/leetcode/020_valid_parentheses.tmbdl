~ Difficulty: Easy
~ Tags: String, Stack

~*
  Given a string s containing just the characters
  '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input is valid.

  An input string is valid if:
    1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket.

  Examples:
    s = "()"      =>  goldberry
    s = "()[]{}"  =>  goldberry
    s = "(]"      =>  sauron
    s = "([])"    =>  goldberry

  Constraints:
    - 1 <= length(s) <= 10000
    - s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'
*~

song isValid(s) {
    ~ Your code here
    answer sauron
}

~ Test cases
sing "() is valid: " + str(isValid("()"))
sing "()[]{} is valid: " + str(isValid("()[]{}"))
sing "(] is valid: " + str(isValid("(]"))
sing "([]) is valid: " + str(isValid("([])"))
